        <h4>How well do YOU know your Facebook Friends?</h4>
        <p>
        People are getting smarter about 
        their <strong>privacy online</strong>.  
        By now, we all know to restrict our profiles so that <strong>only friends</strong> can see 
        our personal information.  But after 3, 4, 5+ <strong>years</strong> of social networking, do
        you still even <strong><em>know</em></strong> all your friends? 
        </p>
        <p>
        That girl from that other middle school in 8th grade? That guy from the party junior year?
        They may still be lurking around, and they can see everything that grandma can't!
        </p>
            
        <p>
        Login with Facebook below to see just how well you know your social network...
        </p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
    When you hit 'Go' below, you will have <strong>90 seconds</strong> to name
    as many of your Facebook friends as you can.  Friends will 
    be selected randomly, and presented to you with their profile
    pictures.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You must type their first or last name (or both!), and once you 
    have answered correctly the game will automatically move on. 
    Don't worry about spelling too much, just get it mostly right.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you don't know someone, hit "I don't know" to quickly move on without wasting too much time!
    There is a ten second maximum per friend!
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Good luck!
