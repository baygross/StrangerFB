        Have you checked your default sharing levels yet?<br /><br />
    
        Things you share with all your friends are distributed to about:<br />
        <%= @current_user.friend_count %> people <br /><br />
    
        		Did you know? That friends can give <em>your</em> personal information to applications? 
        		Do you trust all <%= @current_user.friend_count %> of them to make good decisions. Stay in control of your data and uncheck XXXXXXXXXX<br /><br />
    
        Things you share with friends of friends are distributed to around:<br />
        <%= @fof_count %> people<br /><br />
    
        http://www.takethislollipop.com/
        
        In addition, you are in the following networks:
        <% @my_affiliations.each do |a| %>
            <%= a[:name] + " - " + a[:accuracy] + "%" %> accuracy in this network (<%= a[:attempts] %> attempts)<br />
        <% end %>
        <br />
        But those networks are MUCH larger than the number of friends in them, do you really want to be sharing information with everyone?
        <br /><br />
    
        And finally, data shared with anyone on Facebook goes out to:
        800,000,000,000 people...
        <br /><br />
